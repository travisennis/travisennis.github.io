Over the years, I've collected some useful tools that made some common tasks I need to do while working on Node project a whole lot easier. The following `npx` commands have been some of my favorites.

## 1. Generate .gitignore Files
```bash
npx gitignore <language>
```
This command generates .gitignore files using GitHub's official collection of templates. Just specify your language and get the appropriate .gitignore file.

## 2. Create License Files
```bash
npx license <license>
```
This command generates a standardized LICENSE file with appropriate text, automatically including the current year and project details. It supports various license types including MIT, Apache, and GPL.

## 3. Check Node.js Security
```bash
npx is-my-node-vulnerable
```
This command scans Node.js installations for known security vulnerabilities and indicates when updates are needed for security purposes.

## 4. Hunt Down Unused Code
```bash
npx knip
```
This tool identifies unused files, dependencies, and exports in JavaScript/TypeScript projects. It helps maintain code quality by detecting dead code, which can improve maintainability and reduce bundle sizes.

## 5. Interactive Dependency Updates
```bash
npx npm-check-updates --interactive --format group
```
This interactive tool provides organized package update management, with updates categorized by major, minor, and patch versions. It allows selective updating of dependencies.

## 6. Clean Up node_modules
```bash
npx npkill
```
Another interactive tool that locates and removes node_modules directories across your system. It is particularly useful when working with multiple projects and managing disk space.
