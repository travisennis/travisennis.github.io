<h1 id="randomness-in-javascript">Randomness in JavaScript</h1>
<p>As I started to learn to code generative art, I came to realize that
randomness is a huge part of the toolset. Most of the generative art I
have written relies on randomness throughout the code; I’ll use
randomness to pick my inputs, or choose my color palette, or alter the
program’s execution. Randomness is so central to generative art that I
have spent the last seveal months trying to understand it better. What
folllows is brief introduction of random number generation in
JavaScript.</p>
<p>JavaScript provides a standard function, <code>Math.random</code>,
that is defined in the <a
href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/11.0/index.html#sec-math.random">ECMAScript
Specification</a>. It takes no arguments and returns a positive number
from 0 up to but not including 1. For most purposes,
<code>Math.random</code> is fine, but it does have its drawbacks. First,
its algorithm is not defined and can vary from implementation to
implementation. In practice, it seems that the major browsers and
V8/Node have settled on <code>xorshift128+</code> as the algorithm, but
that is not guaranteed (see <a
href="https://v8.dev/blog/math-random">There’s Math.random(), and then
there’s Math.random() · V8</a>). Second, <code>Math.random</code> is not
cryptographically secure. In most cases, one doesn’t need a
cryptographically secure PRNG, but if you do, then
<code>Math.random</code> is not for you. In browsers, this deficiency
has been addressed with <code>window.crypto.getRandomValues</code>. You
could create an equivalent of <code>Math.random</code> that is backed by
this API roughly like so:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>function secureRandom() {
    const arr = new Uint32Array(1)
    windows.crypto.getRandomValues(arr)
    return arr[0] / 4294967296
}</code></pre>
<p>In reality you would never do this. This would be much less
performant than a simple call to <code>Math.random</code> and unless you
are doing hashing, signature generation, or encryption/decryption, there
is little need for it. And it still suffers from the third issue with
built-in random function in JavaScript - no ability to repeat
sequences.</p>
<p>All random number generators are pseudo-random number generators,
which means they generate sequences of numbers based on algorithm that
alters an intial seed. With a different seed, you get a different
sequence, but with the same seed the random number generator will repeat
the same sequence every time. Unfortuantely you can’t seed the built-in
<code>Math.random</code> or <code>window.crypto.getRandomValues</code>.
You might ask why you would want to control the seed of the algorithm,
but sometimes you need a complex seed to make your random sequence less
predictable and sometimes you need a sequence that is completely
predictable. This is frequently the case in generative art when you
would want to recreate a piece of art. That predictability comes from
being able to provide the seed. There are many seedable random number
generators available in JavaScript:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom">davidbau/seedrandom:
seeded random number generator for Javascript</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://github.com/bryc/code/blob/master/jshash/PRNGs.md">Pseudorandom
number generators</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://github.com/nquinlan/better-random-numbers-for-javascript-mirror">Better
Random Numbers for Javascript</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In generative art libraries, there have been several choices
made:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> uses <code>LCG</code></li>
<li><a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> uses the Park-Miller
algorithm for a seedable PRNG, but otherwise uses
<code>Math.random</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LingDong-/q5xjs">q5xjs</a> uses
<code>Alea</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Which you choose are largely based on your use case, but for me I
typically turn to the <code>mulberry32</code> implementation:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>function mulberry32(a) {
    return function() {
      a |= 0; a = a + 0x6D2B79F5 | 0;
      var t = Math.imul(a ^ a &gt;&gt;&gt; 15, 1 | a);
      t = t + Math.imul(t ^ t &gt;&gt;&gt; 7, 61 | t) ^ t;
      return ((t ^ t &gt;&gt;&gt; 14) &gt;&gt;&gt; 0) / 4294967296;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>It’s a minimalistic, 32-bit implemtentation that is pretty fast in
JavaScript and has good randomness. And despite being 32-bit, its period
(how long the random sequence goes before repeating) is still fairly
large at around 4 billion. An 128-bit algorithm would have a larger
period, but I don’t have a need for sequences that large.</p>
<p>Once you have a seedable PRNG implementation, you have to choose how
to generate a seed. At this point I base my strategy for selecting a
seed on this article, <a
href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-select-a-seed-for-simulation-or-randomization/">How
to select a seed for simulation or randomization | R-bloggers</a>, as it
seems a good enough strategy as any. In JavaScript, the code would
be:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>const seed = Date.now() % 10000</code></pre>
<p>but if you want to go further, then an hash function could be used
such as this MurmurHash3 implementation:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>function xmur3 (str) {
  let h = 1779033703 ^ str.length
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; str.length; i++) {
    h = Math.imul(h ^ str.charCodeAt(i), 3432918353)
    h = h &lt;&lt; 13 | h &gt;&gt;&gt; 19
  }
  return function () {
    h = Math.imul(h ^ h &gt;&gt;&gt; 16, 2246822507)
    h = Math.imul(h ^ h &gt;&gt;&gt; 13, 3266489909)
    return (h ^= h &gt;&gt;&gt; 16) &gt;&gt;&gt; 0
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>which could be used as such:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>const seed = xmur3(&#39;&#39; + Date.now() % 10000)
const rand = mulberry32(seed())
rand()</code></pre>
<p>A good seed sometimes makes all the difference in the quality of the
random number sequence being generated.</p>
<p>Now that we can generate repeatable sequences of random numbers, we
can put them to use. I find the following two functions to be useful
additions:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>function randomFloat (min, max) {
  if (!max) {
    max = min
    min = 0
  }

  return rand() * (max - min) + min
}

function randomInt (min, max) {
  if (!max) {
    max = min
    min = 0
  }

  return Math.floor(randomFloat(min, max))
}</code></pre>
<p>I can use <code>randomFloat</code> to randomly generate points on a
canvas or RGB values for random colors.</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>// generate a random point on the canvas
const x = randomFloat(context.canvas.width)
const y = randomFloat(context.canvas.height)

// generate random rgb values
const r = randomFloat(256)
const g = randomFloat(256)
const b = randomFloat(256)
const color = `rgb(${r}, ${g}, ${b})`</code></pre>
<p>I can use <code>randomInt</code> to choose random indexes of an
array. In fact, a <code>pick</code> function could be written to take
advantage of that so that I can get a random element from an array:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>function pick (array) {
  if (array.length === 0) return undefined
  return array[randomInt(array.length)]
}</code></pre>
<p>This just scratches the surface of what you can do with random
numbers. Over time, you’ll find other uses for randomness, such as
randomly shuffling arrays, adding probability and chance to a program’s
execution, etc. There is plenty more to still learn.</p>
