<h1 id="javascript-generators">JavaScript Generators</h1>
<p>This is some background and references that I put together while
developing my personal generator library, <a
href="https://github.com/travisennis/js-itertools">travisennis/js-itertools</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Generators and iterators are constructs that have long existed in
many languages. I first ran into over 15 years go in Python and then
discovered a similar language feature in F#. I found them to be powerful
and useful tools. When they were first proposed for Javascript was way
back in 2007 when they were proposed for ECMAScript 4, which was later
abandoned. But at the time, a version of interators and generators
existed that were very similar to Python’s implementation and you could
find them implemented both in Mozilla’s Rhino and Spidermonkey
Javascript engines. When I first implemented this library back in 2008
or 2009, I was mostly trying to copy the standard itertools library that
could be found in Python so that I could use it for server-side
scripting in Rhino. After ES4 was shelved, generators were redeveloped
and the version of iterators and generators that exist today in
Javascript is still very similar although a few things are different.
The differences range from the minor, such as the
<code>StopIteration</code> error being replaced by a <code>done</code>
property that is on the object returned from a call to
<code>next()</code>: <code>{done: true}</code>, to the major with the
abandonment of generator expressions which were a concise and elegant
way to construct new generators (I kind of miss these since they made is
pretty trivial to port Python code that used generators into
Javascript). What’s left though is still extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Generators are not as well known as some other newer additions to the
Javascript language, such as Promises and async/await, which had
immediate and practical impacts on how many Javascript developers write
code. Generators on the other hand are seemingly little used directly,
although their inclusion in the language does make other, more
well-known features, possible. For that reason they are worth knowing
about, both in terms of how they work and how to use them.</p>
<p>If you have written a lot of Python, then you are probably familiar
with most widely used generator in that language, the <code>range</code>
function. It’s the most widely used for good reason. You’ve probably
seen the following in everywhere in Javascript:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>for(let i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
    console.log(i)
}</code></pre>
<p>Using the range generator, the above code would be written as
follows:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>for(let i of range(100)) {
    console.log(i)
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>range</code> function will start with 0 and return every
number up to, but not including 100. If you want to start at 10, then
you would write <code>range(10, 100)</code> and if you wanted to count
by fives, then you would write <code>range(10, 100, 5)</code>. The
<code>range</code> function is incredible versatile for writing loops.
When looping through generator functions like this, what you are
actually doing is calling the <code>next()</code> function on the
generator itself. Without a loop you would interact with the generator
like so:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>const r = range(10)
r.next() // {value: 0, done: false}
r.next() // {value: 1, done: false}
...
r.next() // {value: 9, done: true}
r.next() // {value: undefined, done: true}</code></pre>
<p>The values the generator function returns, or yields, are generated
each time the generator’s <code>next()</code> method is called. There
are some fairly interesting implications of this that need knowing.
Let’s say you write a generator function that counts numbers:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>const count = function * (start = 0, step = 1) {
  for (let i = start; true; i += step) {
    yield i
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>This function won’t allocate an infinite amount of numbers, but you
could call <code>next()</code> on this generator and always get the next
number, forever. A sequence this large doesn’t take an infinite amount
of memory since the values are generated as needed. But, before careful,
because this:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>for(let i of count()) {
    console.log(i)
}</code></pre>
<p>would result in an infinite loop. Because of this you must be aware
if the generator you are using does or does not stop yielding values.
You may ask why would you ever want a generator that effectively never
stops, but there are uses. For example, an <code>enumerator()</code>
generator written like so:</p>
<pre class="javascript"><code>const enumerate = function * (iterable) {
  yield * zip(count(), iterable)
}

const e = enumerate(range(0, 1000, 10))
console.log(e.next().value)</code></pre>
<p>Would use count to enumerate the the amount of items in the providing
iterable. The <code>zip</code> generator takes both iterables and
returns a tuple (in current Javascript it is just a two element array)
such as <code>[0, 0]</code>, <code>[1, 10]</code>, <code>[2, 20]</code>…
<code>[100, 990]</code> and so on until the provided iterable is
exhausted. No matter the length of the iterable we provide,
<code>count()</code> will give us a value since it never ends.</p>
<p>Take a look at the references below. Generators are pretty
fascinating in their own right and definitely worth learning.</p>
